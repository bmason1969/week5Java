		 * - Procedural programming is writing one line at the time in a procedural fashion one after the next
		 * object oriented programming (OOP)
		 * DVD player has few different properties
		 * - properties:
		 * - height
		 * -weight
		 * -width
		 * -color
		 * -Functionality
		 * -play
		 * -fast forward
		 * -rewind
		 * -pause
		 * DVD
		 * 	properties
		 * -movie lengths

		 * Four Pillars of OOP:
		 * 1- abstraction: is exposing the essential feature of an entity of an object while hiding the details that don't really matter as much or
		 * change from implementation to implementation
		 * 		triangle is abstract concept
		 * 		table has legs, top. but we need specifics for particular table
		 * 2- Encapsulation
		 * 		is hiding the inner workings of the code so that certain methods are only accessible to certain areas of the code this allows as to make 
		 * 		sure that an object we create or class we create can't be manipulated in a way that is not suppose to
		 * 		-like driving a car, you don't need to know what the engine does you just drive the car, shift, break, steer.
		 * 3- inheritance
		 * 		allows objects or classes to inherit from parent classes 
		 * 		 
		 * 4- Polymorphism: taking different forms
		 * 		Animals communicate in different ways, bark, mew, growl
		 * 		one method can take different forms
		 * 
		 * Class- is how we structure our code in OOP
		 * class is like a blue print
